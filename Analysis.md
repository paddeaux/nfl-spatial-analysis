## Distance Travelled and Team Performance

With the geographic spread of franchises it's no surprise that the travel schedule of an NFL can be hectic. Does a gruelling travel schedule result in poor performance of a team?
In order to look at this there are a few different avenues of inquiry:
* Is there a relationship between the *total distance* travelled by a team over a season and their win/loss record? (season by season basis)
* Does travelling a great distance for an away game influence the performance of a team? (game by game basis)
* What teams in the NFL have the longest/shortest distance to travel over a season?

## Frequency of travel

One aspect of the travel schedule that could effect team performance is the varying times for rest between consectutive games. For example a team may play on Monday night at 9pm EST only to then play on Thursday - this can especially be difficult if along with a shorter rest period the team must travel a far distance.

## Home Field Advantage

Naturally playing at home for a team in any sport would seem like an advantage. Home crowds are the most loyal and rabid fans that will let the team know they're here for them.
Different teams may have varying relationships with their home fans, a team that routinely moves location or has just recently changed franchise location may impact the home crowds.
